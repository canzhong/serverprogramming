    <p id="firstpara"> My favorite players are fast, agile, and are good leaders.
      The list below shows you my favorite players from most effective
      to least effective. However, all contribute to the current
      success of the team.

    <ol>
      <li>Giannis AntedeKoumpo</li>
      <li>Khris Middleton</li>
      <li>Eric Bledsoe</li>
      <li>D.J. Wilson</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="secondpara"> I understand if you are not a fan of the Milwaukee Bucks, but I can
      assure you that we will win the crown in the near future. This team
      is almost as strong as the one that won it all with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul Jabar.</a>
