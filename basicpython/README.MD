Introductory concepts pertaining to python were explored. The following task was implemented.

Write a Python program that implements the simple card game high/low.

At the start, the program prompts the user to enter a number, N, from 5 to 50 for the size of the deck, reprompting as needed. The deck contains cards labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.

Use a list of ints to implement the deck. Initially the deck is ordered, with 0 in index 0, 1 in index 1, and so on. The program must shuffle the deck.

Once the deck is shuffled, the program displays the user's score (initially 0) and the first card from the deck and asks the user if the next card will be higher or lower in value. If the user is correct, one point is added to the users score. If incorrect, a point is deducted from the score. Repeat this process until there are zero or one remaining cards, at which point the game ends.
