Concepts from django were demonstrated. The following tasks was implemented.

Write a simple application that (once deployed) would allow students to log encounters with on-street parking checkers in an effort to predict patterns and avoid tickets. A get request to the home page of the application displays a form that requests the date and time the ticket was issued and the location. In this simple app location is just a text field, but you should use the HTML5 datetime input element to gather time information. After the user submits this form (via post request to the same url) the application displays a table of all previous tickets that have been logged into the system. You should use a global list of ticket tuples. Date-time information can be displayed in the raw text form that comes from the HTML5 input element.

The application will typically be used from a phone so the width of the interface should be no more than 320 pixels, centered. On the results page,date-times should be displayed in red using a monospaced font. You will use a loop in the result page's template to render the table of tickets. The results page should end with a link back to the form (anchor tags generate get requests).
