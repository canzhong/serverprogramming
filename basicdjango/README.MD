Introductory concepts pertaining to Django are implemented. The following tasks are demonstrated.

- create a view function in views.py that calls render to display each page
- The site has 4 pages, so you will need 4 views
- create a path object in urls.py for each page
- Update the CSS file with all the CSS rules from assignment 1
- Add the image file(s) to the static directory, make sure they are correctly referenced in HTML/CSS
- Test the website to make sure all links and images work correctly.
